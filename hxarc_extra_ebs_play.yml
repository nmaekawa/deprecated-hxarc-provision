# playbook to add extra-ebs to hxarc server
# -----------------------------------------
#
# assumes playbook hxarc_play.yml was already applied!
# it creates a new 16G ebs volume, attaches to the hxarc
# server, formats it, and mounts it.
# it then re-configures hxarc service to use the new ebs
# as the data folder (for work only, db is untouched)
